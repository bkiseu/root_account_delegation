# AWS Organization Root Access Delegation - POC Implementation Plan

## Overview
This POC demonstrates how to implement AWS Organization Root Access Delegation to significantly improve security posture by enabling delegated access to root-level capabilities through a management admin account, eliminating the need for direct root credential usage across member accounts.

## Prerequisites
- AWS Organization with management account and member accounts
- Administrative access to the Organization management account
- IAM permissions to create/modify roles and policies
- CLI or console access to test the implementation

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Preparation and Assessment

1. **Inventory Current Root Usage**
   - Document all current use cases requiring root credentials
   - Identify which member accounts actively use root credentials
   - Create a tracking spreadsheet with account IDs and root usage patterns

2. **Verify Organization Settings**
   - Confirm all accounts are part of the AWS Organization
   - Verify management account has appropriate service control policies
   - Check that organization has all features enabled: `aws organizations describe-organization`

3. **Create Test Environment**
   - Set up a sandbox member account for testing
   - Document baseline configuration before changes

### Phase 2: Configure Root Access Delegation

1. **Enable Root Access Delegation in Organization**
   ```bash
   # Using AWS CLI to enable the feature
   aws organizations enable-root-access-for-member-accounts
   ```

2. **Create Delegation Role in Management Account**
   ```bash
   # Create IAM policy for delegated administrators
   aws iam create-policy \
       --policy-name DelegatedRootAccessPolicy \
       --policy-document file://delegated-root-access-policy.json
   
   # Create IAM role for delegated administrators
   aws iam create-role \
       --role-name DelegatedRootAccessRole \
       --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json
   
   # Attach policy to role
   aws iam attach-role-policy \
       --role-name DelegatedRootAccessRole \
       --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:policy/DelegatedRootAccessPolicy
   ```

3. **Configure Trust Relationship**
   Create a `trust-policy.json` file:
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::MANAGEMENT_ACCOUNT_ID:root"
         },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
         "Condition": {}
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

4. **Create Delegation Policy**
   Create a `delegated-root-access-policy.json` file:
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "organizations:ExecuteRootAction"
         ],
         "Resource": "*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation

1. **Test Root Action Delegation on Sandbox Account**
   ```bash
   # Assume the delegated role
   aws sts assume-role \
       --role-arn arn:aws:iam::MANAGEMENT_ACCOUNT_ID:role/DelegatedRootAccessRole \
       --role-session-name DelegatedRootAccessTest
   
   # Use the temporary credentials to execute a root action
   # Example: Create an S3 bucket policy
   aws organizations execute-root-action \
       --action-name UpdateS3BucketPolicy \
       --account-id MEMBER_ACCOUNT_ID \
       --parameters '{"BucketName":"test-bucket","PolicyDocument":"{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":{\"AWS\":\"*\"},\"Action\":\"s3:GetObject\",\"Resource\":\"arn:aws:s3:::test-bucket/*\"}]}"}'
   ```

2. **Verify Delegated Access Works**
   - Check S3 bucket policy has been updated
   - Verify CloudTrail logs show the action performed by the delegated role, not root
   - Test additional root actions needed by your organization

### Phase 4: Documentation and Cleanup Plan

1. **Document Successful Delegation Flows**
   - List all root actions successfully delegated
   - Document any limitations or edge cases discovered

2. **Create Root Credential Removal Plan**
   For each member account:
   ```bash
   # Disable access keys for root user
   aws iam delete-access-key \
       --access-key-id ACCESS_KEY_ID \
       --user-name root
   
   # Remove MFA devices
   aws iam deactivate-mfa-device \
       --user-name root \
       --serial-number MFA_SERIAL_NUMBER
   
   # Note: Password changes must be done through console
   ```

## Potential Limitations/Blockers
- Not all root actions may be available for delegation (document any discovered)
- Service control policies may impact delegation functionality
- Legacy configurations might rely on direct root access
- Account recovery processes will need to be updated

## Production Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Complete all POC validation steps
- [ ] Create CHG request with detailed implementation plan
- [ ] Schedule maintenance window for implementation
- [ ] Prepare rollback plan
- [ ] Implement monitoring for delegated root actions
- [ ] Document new emergency access procedures

## Timeline
1. POC Setup & Testing: 3 days
2. Documentation & CHG Creation: 1 day
3. Production Implementation: 1 day
4. Validation & Root Credential Removal: 2-3 days
